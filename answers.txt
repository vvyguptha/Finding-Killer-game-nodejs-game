The killer is the victim's coworker.

Here's the explanation:

The librarian's clue suggests that the victim had an argument with their coworker before the murder, which makes the coworker a likely suspect.

The coworker's alibi seems solid at first, but on closer inspection, it's not very convincing. She claims to have been eating a sandwich in the break room, but there's no mention of anyone else being there to confirm her story. Additionally, the coworker doesn't mention seeing or hearing anything unusual during the time of the murder, which is suspicious.

The patron's clue about the man with the green hat is a red herring, designed to distract from the real killer.

So, based on the clues, Detective Sarah concludes that the coworker had the motive and opportunity to commit the murder, and that her alibi is not strong enough to prove her innocence. Therefore, the coworker is the killer.

The killer is Mrs. White.

Here's the explanation:

At first glance, it appears that each suspect has an airtight alibi. However, upon closer inspection, there is one inconsistency that gives away the identity of the killer.

Notice that Mrs. White claims to have been in the kitchen, preparing dessert, at the time of the murder. However, when James went to the kitchen, he found no evidence that dessert had been prepared. In fact, the kitchen was completely clean and tidy, as though no cooking had taken place.

This inconsistency suggests that Mrs. White was lying about her alibi. Furthermore, her position in the kitchen gave her easy access to the garden where the murder took place, and the lack of alibi makes her a likely suspect.

Therefore, Detective James concludes that Mrs. White had the motive and opportunity to commit the murder, and that her alibi is not strong enough to prove her innocence. Hence, Mrs. White is the killer.

 The killer is Lady White.

Here's the explanation:

Riddle #1: The answer is a compass. This clue tells us to look for something that goes from north to south and is made of metal. The only guest at the masquerade ball who fits this description is Mr. Silver, who is wearing a compass mask. However, the riddle says to look for the killer's name where the answer is the same, so we need to keep looking.

Riddle #2: The answer is a musical note. This clue tells us to look for something that can be sharp or dull, and is used in music. When Alex looks at the victim's back, he sees that there is a musical note drawn in blood. This indicates that the killer was wearing a mask with a musical note on it. The only guest at the ball with this mask is Lady White.

Riddle #3: The answer is the number 24. This clue tells us to count the number of steps in the killer's life. When Alex investigates further, he discovers that Lady White is the only guest at the ball who has taken exactly 24 steps in her life, which matches the answer to the riddle.

Taken together, these clues point to Lady White as the killer. Therefore, Detective Alex concludes that Lady White had the motive and opportunity to commit the murder, and that the riddles provide enough evidence to identify her as the killer.
